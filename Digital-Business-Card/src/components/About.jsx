        I`m a very ambitious front-end developer looking for a role in an
        established IT company with the opportunity to work with the latest
        technologies on challenging and diverse projects.
        <br />
        I`m quiet confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on
        improving my chops one design problem at a time.
